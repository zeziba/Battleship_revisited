We are creating a basic battleship game, not only with full
sized ships but with it's full size board as well. You can have two computers duke it out
or you can play manually.

This little project was a means to an end. While building this program I learned a lot about Python and programming
    in general. That is why a lot of the code in not as neat as it could be but I do believe that I did the best
    could at the time.
