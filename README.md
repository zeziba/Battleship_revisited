###Battle Ship - Revisited

######This is a recreation of a program which I originally made when i first started to program. I have updated it to display the new ideas and techniques that I have learned.

As of January 9, 2019 this program is in a working condition. Below are some things I still wish to work on and complete.

1. Update unittest to better reflect usage of the program
2. Update output to read better
3. Create an installer for pip
4. Integrate automated unittest and integration
